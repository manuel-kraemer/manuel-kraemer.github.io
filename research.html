        During my scientific career, I specialized on
        quantum cosmology and one of the main lines of my research
        was the search for effects of a theory of quantum
        gravity in the Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropy
        spectrum.
        <br />
        <br />
        I focussed on using canonical quantum cosmology that
        leads to the Wheeler–DeWitt equation. Even though the
        Wheeler–DeWitt equation is probably not the final answer to
        the problem of quantum gravity and should be superseded at
        the most fundamental level by a theory like string theory
        that unifies all forces in nature, its conservative
        construction should give us insights into the quantum
        nature of the universe and allow us to study general
        properties of a theory of quantum gravity in cosmological
        models and for black holes. In particular, using the
        Wheeler–DeWitt equation to determine effects of quantum
        gravity should give us an estimate of their magnitude.

            <td valign="top">The Wheeler–DeWitt equation is the
            result of a direct canonical quantization of general
            relativity. It is constructed in the same way as the
            Schrödinger equation by looking for a wave equation
            that gives back general relativity in the semiclassical
            limit. Therefore, we have a well-defined semiclassical
            approximation at hand.
            <br />
            <br />
            At the beginning of my PhD studies, I worked on using
            the above-mentioned semiclassical approximation of the
            Wheeler–DeWitt equation, which leads to a Schrödinger
            equation with quantum-gravitational correction terms,
            to determine the effect of this correction onto the CMB
            spectrum. This first model was still simplified in the
            sense that we only used perturbations of the scalar
            field instead of gauge-invariant perturbations
            involving the metric. However, the resulting article
            published in PRL <a href=
            "http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.4967">[1]</a> has set the
            stage for a series of papers refining the model
            <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0531">[2]</a> and
            eventually using Mukhanov–Sasaki variables <a href=
            "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05545">[3</a>,<a href=
            "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02932">4]</a>, which allowed
            us to explicitly compare the corrections we found to
            observations. We have also generalized our
            analysis in order to study excited states of
            inflationary perturbations <a href=
            "http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01234">[5]</a>. Recently, we revisited the issue of the unitarity of the corrections <a href=
            "http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06426">[6]</a>.
            <br />
            <br />
            These corrections, which are most prominent on large
            scales and show a specific behavior of
            <em>k</em><span style=
            "position: relative;bottom: 0.5em;font-size: 0.8em;">−3</span>,
            are only of the order of 10<span style=
            "position: relative;bottom: 0.5em;font-size: 0.8em;">−10</span>
            and as such cannot be seen in the CMB. However,
            galaxy–galaxy correlations, where cosmic variance is
            not present, are still a possibility to look for such
            effects. Given that the magnitude of these corrections
            is fundamentally limited by the energy scale of
            inflation, more sizable corrections could only come
            from scenarios where a pre-inflationary phase is
            present, which we will discuss below.

            <td valign="top">The so-called third quantization
            approach arises from a quantum-field-theoretical
            formulation of the Wheeler–DeWitt equation where
            universes described by a certain wave function are
            represented as “particles” that can be created and
            annihilated. Hence, it is a way to describe an ensemble
            of universes, i. e. a multiverse.
            <br />
            <br />
            If one describes an (eternally) inflating universe in
            the third quantization picture, one ends up with an
            ensemble of sub-universes that exhibit a distinctive
            pre-inflationary phase which behaves like stiff matter
            with the equation of state <em>p = ρ</em> and appears
            as an <em>a</em><span style=
            "position: relative;bottom: 0.5em;font-size: 0.8em;">−6</span>-term
            in the Friedmann equation. If the parent universe has
            positive curvature, this pre-inflationary phase
            corresponds to a baby-universe phase that is separated
            from the asymptotic de Sitter phase by a Euclidean
            region. We have thus analyzed the probability that a
            universe can tunnel from the baby-universe phase to the
            de Sitter phase <a href=
            "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00025">[7]</a>.
            <br />
            <br />
            Given that such a pre-inflationary phase can lead to
            effects in the CMB spectrum that are larger than the
            effects from a semiclassical approximation, we
            continued our studies using a flat parent universe
            without a Euclidean region to calculate the effects of
            the pre-inflationary phase onto the primordial scalar
            power spectrum in a sub-universe <a href=
            "http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05138">[8]</a>.
            <br />
            <br />
            The result is that on the largest scales there is a
            suppression of power followed by a bump leading to an
            enhancement. As it turns out, in order to get a sizable
            effect for the suppression to explain the
            quadrupole anomaly in the CMB, the bump is enhanced
            that much that the model becomes incompatible with the
            CMB data.
            <br />
            <br />
            Given that the model described above is in some tension
            with observations, we also studied a multiverse
            model where an explicit interaction between universes
            is implemented. It had already been shown that such an
            interaction leads to a different pre-inflationary phase
            and we found that such a model can indeed be compatible
            with observations and might even lead us towards an
            explanation of the CMB quadrupole discrepancy <a href=
            "http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09133">[9]</a>.

            <td valign="top">When I was a postdoc in the Szczecin
            Cosmology Group, its main research topic was to analyze
            universe models with varying fundamental couplings. In
            this context, I was involved in a project analyzing
            models with a varying gravitational coupling, which
            exhibit a cyclic evolution, in the third quantization
            approach <a href=
            "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04773">[11]</a>.
            <br />
            <br />
            We used the model of a multiverse consisting of cyclic
            universes going from a big bang to a big crunch,
            <em>a</em>(<em>t</em>) ∝ sin(<em>t</em>), or to a big
            rip, <em>a</em>(<em>t</em>) ∝ tan(<em>t</em>), which
            can both be inferred from a variation of the
            gravitational constant. We calculated the entropy and
            temperature of entanglement to see whether these
            quantities show a distinct behavior at the classical
            singularities and we concluded that the divergence of
            the entanglement temperature is a suitable measure of
            the “quantumness” of a point in the evolution of a
            universe.
